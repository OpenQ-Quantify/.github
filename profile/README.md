# OpenQQuantify

## What is OpenQQuantify?

OpenQQuantify is an open‑source, AI‑powered Electronic Design Automation (EDA) & simulation platform that lets you design, prototype, and validate electronics faster than ever. By uniting Generative AI, machine learning, autonomous multi‑agent orchestration, and a cloud‑native, game‑engine digital‑twin, we accelerate every phase of the hardware lifecycle — from napkin concept ⇢ mass‑production.

Prompt‑Driven Engineering: Instead of clicking through dozens of disjointed CAD tools, simply describe the device you want in plain English (or Python) and let our AI agents generate schematics, firmware, documentation, and a photorealistic digital twin that you can play‑test inside a AAA‑grade game engine.

## End‑to‑End Development Pipeline

Below is the typical journey from idea → shipping hardware on OpenQQuantify. Each stage is handled (or co‑piloted) by a specialised AI agent that speaks our internal Agent Protocol v3.

| Stage | AI Agent | Key Outputs | Underlying Tech |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Prompt Intake & Spec Synthesis | SpecAgent | Functional spec (markdown + JSON schema) | LLM (OQ‑GPT‑13B) |
| 2. Generative Schematic & PCB | DesignAgent | KiCad / Altium project, 2‑D & 3‑D renders | Graph transformers, Constraint solving |
| 3. Firmware & Driver Generation | FirmwareAgent | C/C++ or Rust codebase, unit tests, CMSIS packs | Code‑gen models, HAL knowledge base |
| 4. Simulation & Verification | SimAgent | Mixed‑signal waveforms, power/thermal plots | SPICE × ML surrogate, Monte Carlo on K8s |
| 5. Digital‑Twin Real‑World Emulation | TwinAgent | Unreal / Unity scene with physics hooks | gRPC bridge, NVIDIA PhysX, Azure Remote Render |
| 6. Iterative Optimisation | OptAgent | Pareto‑optimal BOM & topology suggestions | Reinforcement learning, Bayesian search |
| 7. Documentation & Compliance | DocAgent | PDF manual, datasheets, CE/FCC test plan | LLM + templater, LaTeX engine |
| 8. Manufacturing Handoff | MfgAgent | Gerbers, pick‑&‑place CSV, assembly drawing | IPC‑2581, JLC & MacroFab APIs |
| 9. Post‑Launch Telemetry | FleetAgent | OTA updates, anomaly detection dashboards | MQTT, TimescaleDB, Tiny ML |

All agents are fully autonomous but observe human‑in‑the‑loop guardrails — you approve every gating milestone via pull‑request‑style reviews.

## Digital Twin Powered by AAA Game Engines

Photorealistic Physics: We compile your board's STEP + BOM into a real‑time rigid‑body + thermal model inside Unreal Engine 5 (fallback to Unity HDRP).

Sensor & Actuator Emulation: The game engine hosts plug‑in stubs for IMUs, cameras, GNSS, LiDAR, displays, motors, and RF modules so you can script integration tests before touching real silicon.

Interactive Play‑Test: Hot‑reload firmware and watch the twin respond instantly; perfect for robotics, wearables, and automotive HMIs.

Cloud or Local: Spin up GPU instances on AWS NVIDIA L4 or run headless in a CI container for regression.

Think "Kerbal Space Program for hardware engineering," but deterministic and hooked to your Git commits.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```
# 1 Install CLI
curl -sSL https://get.openqquantify.com | bash

# 2 Bootstrap a project (Raspberry Pi + IMU + OLED display)
oq init "portable air‑quality sensor, battery‑powered, OLED UI, logs to SD card"

# 3 Let the AI run the pipeline 🪄
cd portable-air-quality-sensor
oq run all --cloud

# 4 Open the digital twin in your browser
oq twin launch --url
```

Agent progress is streamed to your terminal as a live tree view; artifacts land in `./build/`.

## Installation Options

1‑Click Cloud Sandbox: Login at https://www.openqquantify.com (free tier ≤ 6 hours build time).

Docker Compose (local): `docker compose up` — spins controller + agents + web UI.

From Source: Clone, run `make install`, then `make dev` (requires Python ≥3.10, Node ≥20, Docker).

Tip: GPU is optional; CPU‑only mode uses quantised models.

## Example Prompt‑to‑Product Walkthrough

User prompt ↴
"Design a handheld thermal camera using ESP32‑S3, 2.4‑inch LCD, AMG8833 thermal sensor,
USB‑C charging, plastic enclosure, and optional Wi‑Fi streaming."

SpecAgent extracts power budget, UI constraints, thermal profiles.

DesignAgent outputs KiCad project + 3‑D step files.

FirmwareAgent writes ESP‑IDF code with FreeRTOS tasks for sensor, UI, and OTA.

SimAgent validates power‑on surge and thermal spread at 45 °C ambient.

TwinAgent spawns an Unreal scene; you rotate the camera using WSAD and verify frame rate.

Iterate by commenting: "add physical joystick, keep BOM < $60" — agents refactor.

Approve pull request; MfgAgent uploads to PCBWay; first article arrives in ~6 days.

## Autonomy & Safety

| Layer | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Guardrails | JSON Schemas + GitHub PR review gates |
| Policy Enforcement | SPDX license scanner, banned‑IP blocks |
| Simulation Fuzzing | Randomised IO patterns to detect unsafe states |
