OpenQ Quantify is an open‑source, AI‑powered Electronic Design Automation (EDA) & simulation platform that lets you design, prototype, and validate electronics faster than ever. By uniting Generative AI, machine learning, autonomous multi‑agent orchestration, and a cloud‑native, game‑engine digital twin, we accelerate every phase of the hardware lifecycle from concept to production.

## Supported Hardware Platforms

- **MCUs:** STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, Nordic nRF52, TI CC13xx/26xx  
- **SoCs:** Raspberry Pi CM4, NXP i.MX8, AMD Kraken AI Edge  
- **Sensors:** Bosch BME-series, TI AFE, Analog Devices IMUs, AMS optical, VL53LXX ToF  
- **Comms:** Wi-Fi, BLE, LoRa, CAN, MQTT, UWB  
- **Custom Parts:** Add new components via the Part-Library SDK
